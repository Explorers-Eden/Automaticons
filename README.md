## üìñ Description

**Automaticons** are little helpers which will help you farm ressources for your building projects. Simply craft them, equip them with an item and wait for the materials they gather for you. It's as easy as it sounds. If an Automaticon has run out of durability points it needs recharging. To recharge an Automaticon simply right click it with the same tool it is holding.

## ‚≠ê Features
- 6 Tiers, each with 5 different Automaticon professions
- Custom crafting recipes for each Automaticon
- Automaticon animations
- Randomised appearence for Automaticons  
- Randomised names for Automaticons
- A couple of new advancements
- Integration for [Katters Structures](https://modrinth.com/datapack/katters-structures) datapack

## üõ†Ô∏è How to
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

But if you are playing on a PaperMC Server (or a PaperMC Fork like Purpur) make sure to set **allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards** in your paper config files to true in order for everything to work properly.
